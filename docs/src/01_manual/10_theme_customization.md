    Some of these features are not yet implemented, this section is incomplete. Features relating to this section are planned to release with mousetrap version 0.2.*.

### Global Theme

Each pre-made widget in Mousetrap has their exact look specified in what is called a **theme**.  These themes are applied globally, meaning they affect every widget associated with our app.

Mousetrap supports four default application-wide themes, which are a values of enum [`Theme`](@ref):

+ `THEME_DEFAULT_LIGHT`
+ `THEME_DEFAULT_DARK`
+ `THEME_HIGH_CONTRAST_LIGHT`
+ `THEME_HIGH_CONTRAST_DARK`

At any point after the back-end has been initialized, we can swap the global theme using [`set_current_theme!`](@ref). This will immediately change the look  of all widgets and windows, allowing apps to change the entire GUI with just one function call at runtime.

For example, to create a window that has a button to switch between light and dark themes in its header bar, we could do the following:

```julia
main() do app::Application

    window = Window(app)

    # add theme swap button to windows header bar
    header_bar = get_header_bar(window)
    swap_button = Button()
    set_tooltip_text!(swap_button, "Click to Swap Themes")
    connect_signal_clicked!(swap_button, app) do self::Button, app::Application

        # get currently used theme
        current = get_current_theme(app)

        # swap light with dark, preservng whether the theme is high contrast
        if current == THEME_DEFAULT_DARK
            next = THEME_DEFAULT_LIGHT
        elseif current == THEME_DEFAULT_LIGHT
            next = THEME_DEFAULT_DARK
        elseif current == THEME_HIGH_CONTRAST_DARK
            next = THEME_HIGH_CONTRAST_LIGHT
        elseif current == THEME_HIGH_CONTRAST_LIGHT
            next = THEME_HIGH_CONTRAST_DARK
        end

        # set new theme
        set_current_theme!(app, next)
    end
    push_front!(header_bar, swap_button)
    present!(window)
end
```
