## Introduction: The Command Pattern

As we create more and more complex applications, keeping track of how / when to trigger which functionality gets harder and harder. An application can have hundreds, if not thousands of functions, all linked to one or more triggers such a buttons, menus, keyboard shortcuts, etc. 

Things will get out of hand very quickly, which is why there's a software design pattern just for this purpose: the [**command pattern**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern).

A **command**, henceforth called **action**, is an object which has the following components:
+ A **function**, which is the actions behavior
+ An **ID** which uniquely identifies the action
+ An optional **state**, which is a boolean
+ An optional **shortcut trigger**, also often called a keybinding

In mousetrap, a command is respresented by the type [`Action`](@ref).

## Action

As early as possible, we should drop the habit of defining application behavior inside a global function. Unless a function is used exactly once, it should be an action.

For example, in the previous chapter, we declared a \a{Button} with the following behavior:

```julia
button = Button()
connect_signal_clicked!(button) do self::Button
    println("clicked")
end
```

In this section, we will learn how to reproduce this behavior using the command pattern.

### Action IDs

When creating an action, we first need to choose the actions **ID**. An ID is any identifier that unique identifies the action. The ID can only contain the character `[a-zA-Z0-9_-.]`, that is, all roman letters, numbers 0 to 9, `_`, `-` and `.`. The dot is usually reserved to simulate scoping. 
For example, one action could be called `image_file.save`, while another is called `text_file.save`. Both actions say what they do, `save` a file, but the prefix makes clear which part of the application they act on.

An approriate ID for our button behavior would therefore be `example.print_clicked`. 

### Action Function

Armed with this ID, we can create the second part of a command / action: its function. We assign an actions function us `set_function!`:

```julia
action = Action("example.print_clicked", app)
set_function!(action) do x::Action
    println("clicked")
end
```

Where `app` is a reference to our `Application` instance.

The function registered using `set_function!` is required to have the following signature:
```julia
(::Action, [::Data_t]) -> Nothing
```

We see that, much like with signal handlers, we can pass an optional argument containing data to the function.

### Triggering Actions

At any point, we can call [`activate!`](@ref), which will trigger the actions callback. This is not the only way to trigger an action, however. 

`Button` provides [`set_action!`](@ref), which makes it such that when the button is clicked, the action is triggered:

```julia
action = Action("example.print_clicked", app)
set_function!(action) do x::Action
    println("clicked")
end

button = Button()
set_action!(button, action)
```
```
clicked
```

So far, this doesn't seem to have an upsides over just connecting to signal `clicked`. This is about to change.

## Disabling Actions

Similarly to how blocking signals work, we can disable an action using [`set_enabled!`](@ref). If set to `false`, calling `activate!` will trigger no behavior, and **all connected widgets are automatically disabled**. This means we do not need to keep track of which exact widgets call the action, to disable all of them, we can simply disable the action.

## Action Maps

Eagle-eyed readers may have noticed that `Action`s constructor requires an instance of our `Application`. This is because the two are linked internally, all actions are registered with the application and are accesible to all widgets. In this way, `Application` itself acts as an action map, an index of all actions.

Once `set_function!` was called, we can, at any point, retrieve the action from the application using `get_action!`:

```julia
let action = Action("example.print_clicked", app)
    set_function!(action) do x::Action
        println("clicked")
    end
end

# `action` is no longer defined here, instead, we can do:

activate!(get_action(app, "example.print_clicked"))
```

Where we used a [let-blocked](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#let) to create a hard scope, meaning at the end of the block, `action`, the Julia-side object, is not longer defined. We can nonetheless retrieve it form our `Application` instance instead. 

This way, we do not have to keep track of actions ourself, by simply remember the ID we can - at any point - trigger the action from anywhere in our application.

## Stateful vs Stateless Actions

When using `set_function!` to register all callback with an action, that action will be considered **stateless**. It does not have an internal state. In opposition to this are **stateful** functions, which, along with their callback and ID, also keep track of a state, which is a boolean.

To create a stateful action, we need to use [`set_stateful_function!`](@ref) to register a callback. The callback for a stateful function has to have the signature

```julia
(::Action, ::Bool) -> Bool
```
Where the bool argument is the current state of the action, and the boolean return type is the state of the action after the callback has been invoked:

```julia
stateful_action = Action("example.stateful", app)
set_stateful_function!(stateful_action) do x::Action, current_state::Bool
    println("stateful action activated")
    next_state = !current_state
    return next_state
end
```
Along with from within the stateful actions callback, we can also modify the state from the outside: [`set_state!`](@ref) and [`get_state`](@ref) access the internal state of a stateful action. If we are unsure about whether an action is stateful or stateless, we can call [`get_is_stateful`](@ref), which returns `true` if the actions callback was registered using `set_stateful_function!`.

## Shortcuts

Any action, regardless of whether it is stateful or stateless can have a number of optional **shortcut triggers**, also commonly called **keybindings**. A keybinding is a combination of keyboard keys, that, when pressed, trigger an action exactly once. Common keyboard shortcuts familiar to most users of modern operating systems are `Control + A` to select all or `Control + Z` to undo an action. These will not usually be predefined for our applications. Instead, we will have to implement them using actions.

### Shortcut Trigger Syntax

Before we can learn about keybindings, we need to talk about keys. In mousetrap, keyboard keys
are split into two groups: **modifiers**  and **non-modifiers**.

A modifier is one of the following:
+ `Shift`
+ `Control`
+ `Alt`

!!! Note Additional modifiers include `AltGr`, `Meta` and `Win`. These are keyboard-layout and/or OS-specific. See [here](https://docs.gtk.org/gdk4/flags.ModifierType.html) for more information.

A non-modifier, is any key that is not a modifiers. 

A keybinding, or shortcut trigger, henceforth called "shortcut", is the combinations of **any number of modifiers, along with exactly one non-modifier key**. A few examples:

+ `a` (that is the `A` keyboard key) is a shortcut
+ `<Control><Shift>plus` (that is the `+` keyboard key) is a shortcut
+ `<Alt><Control><Shift>` is **not** a shortcut, because it does not contain a non-modifier
+ `<Control>xy` (that is the `X` key *and* the `Y` key) is **not** a shortcut, because it contains more than one non-modifier key

Shortcuts are represented as strings, which have a specific syntax. As seen above, each modifier is enclosed in `<``>`, with no spaces. After the group of modifiers, the non-modifier key identifier is placed after the last modifiers `>`. Some more examples:

+ "Control + C" is written `<Control>c`
+ "Alt + LeftArrow" is written as `<Alt>Left` (sic, `L` is capitalized)
+ "Shift + 1" is written as `exclam`

That last one requires explanation. On most keyboard layouts, to type `!` the user has to press the shift modifier key, then press the `1` key. When "Shift + 1" is pressed, mousetrap does not receive this keyboard key event as-is, instead, it receives a single key event for the `!` key, with no modifiers. The identification of `!` is `exclam`, hence why "Shift + 1" is written as `exclam`.

!!! Note "Hint: Looking up Key Identifiers"

An example on how to look up the key identifier as a string will be performed here.

Let's say we want to write the shortcut "Control + Space". We know that we can write "Control" as `<Control>`. Next, we navigate to https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/blob/main/gdk/gdkkeysyms.h#L384, which, in line 384, says `GDK_KEY_space`. The identifier name is the last part of the constant name as a string, without the `"GDK_KEY_"`. So for this constant `GDK_KEY_space`, the id is `space`. Therefore, we write "Control + Space" as `<Control>space`. For the left arrow, the constant is named `GDK_KEY_Left`, therefore its identifier is `Left`, with a capitel `L`.

One more obscure example, to write "Alt + Beta", that is the `Î²` key on the somewhat rare greek keyboard layout, we find the constant named `GDK_KEY_Greek_BETA` in [line 1049](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/blob/main/gdk/gdkkeysyms.h#L1049). Erasing `GDK_KEY_` again, the key's string identifier is `Greek_BETA`. "Alt + Beta Key" is therefore written as `<Alt>Greek_BETA`

If we make an error and use the wrong identifier, a soft warning will be printed at runtime, informing us of this fact.
